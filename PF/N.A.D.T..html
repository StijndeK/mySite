  <h4> Audio programming, nonlinear audio design </h4>

    <strong> 
      As a game audio designer I am hindered during my creative process, due to the discrepancy between the nonlinearity of my work and the linear character of standard audio production software.

        Standard linear audio production tools offer little to none nonlinear sequencing, transitioning, parameter adaption and probability functionalities. 
        Furthermore, linear sequencers are not optimised to provide a visual representation of nonlinear systems. 
        Current standard middleware solutions are more focussed on optimising implementation and less on tackling the obstructions in the design stage of a project. 
        These issues cause testing and prototyping to take unnecessary long and obscures communication with collaborators. 
        This obstructs the workflow and discourages innovation.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>

    Nonlinear Audiosystems Design Tools or NADT, is a range of experiments in the form of prototypes for tools to tackle these issues. 
    By prototyping various tools to adress issues caused by the nonlinearity of video games in relation to the linearity of audio production software, I hope to improve the process. 
  </p>

  <h3>
    Main issues
  </h3>
  <p>
    The current issues that arise when designing nonlinear audiosystems for games are divisible into 3 general subjects: 
    The inability to quickly test and prototype audio systems with their audio, the lack of overview current standard tools provide (which also hinders communication)
    and the lack of context of visuals and interaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    With an aproach that favors quick testing and prototyping, I hope to approach the problem from multiple different angles.
    This should provide a more general sense of what works well and what doesn't, before focussing on specific elements.
    The disadvantage of this approach is that many interesting details will not (yet) be addressed.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Modular 'flexible' tools
  </h3>
  <p>
    To be able to function as a proof of concept on how to tackle the issues, the tools need to be flexible and can't be specific to any one game or phase in gameaudio.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>'.. the game industry is undergoing constant change .. . The only solution to this unpredictable situation is granularity--that is , the goal to build a flexible set of tools that are constantly able to update, evolve and adapt'
    </i>

  <h3>
    Current status
  </h3>

  <p>
    This project is still in progress.
    So far, I have worked on 3 experiments. All of which have reached their research goals, but can be much further explored in the future.

    <h3> Quantised synchronisation</h3>
    <p>
      I decided to start with quantised grid-based bar synchronisation, based on the following quote from Colin Walder:
    </p>
    <p> 
      <i>
      'For basic synchronization, I start with bars, beats and grid since it is trivial to prepare the interactive music to support these, and because the are they are the most straightforward to understand in terms of mapping to gameplay.'
      </i>
      (Game Audio Programming: Principles and Practices)
    </p>

    <h3> Status</h3>
    <p> Even though a lot more information can be obtained from filenames, the project succeeds in its goal to test if this type of system can be used to improve the process.</p>

      VPA is a prototype tool that uses a visual overview and interface along with the automatic file loading functionality carried over from the previous experiment,  
      to look into upgrading the process of prototyping nonlinear systems and improving (interdisciplinary) communication. 
      Because audio is a nonvisual medium and therefore always is experienced linearely, it can prove difficult to fully understand nonlinear audiosystems design.

          Files are loaded from a given folder location and information on layers and transition-possibilities is obtained from them.
          Layerboxes can be spawned from the Spawner.
          A layerbox holds a layer with all its variations.
          When dragged into the sequencer the Layerbox is then given a X and Y parameter.
          These parameters can be set to certain values by moving the X and Y sliders.
          The transitions between variations within layers aren't visualised (yet), but behave in the same way as the previous experiment where the numbers at the end of a filename indicate to what variations a variation can transition.

      As the current prototype is bound to time restrictions and made to quickly test the most important features,
      I have created a mockup showcasing future possibilities. 
      This version still only contains a small portion of possible features to be added, but serves to showcase the concept.
      The mockup shows how components can dynamically be loaded in, based on what is useful for the project. 
      This also makes it easier to add components in the future.

          As visual context is an important part of game audio, a component to load in visual context has been added. 
          In the future I'd like the program to style the entire interface based on input visuals.
          I'd also like to add some simple 'template' games, so that the audio can be tested with its interactive context as well.
          The 'Layer Containers' now show which variation of the layer is being played.
          As oneshots are another important context to test with looping audio, a component to play sound effects has also been added. 
          In the future I'd like to add sidechaining and randomisation (pitch, gain, etc) functionalities.

    <h3> Systems design </h3>

    <p>
      The current prototype has 4 main components. 
      The Fileloader loads audiofiles and parses information obtained from their names. 
      The Spawner allows the user to spawn Layers containing horizontal loops with variations, that can then be dragged into the Sequencer. 
      The Sequencer checks if certain parameters are checked to see if and what sound needs to be played. 
      The Controler eventually calls the audio.
      Below a general overview of the current system.

    <h3> Improvements </h3>
    <p>
      As an investigation into using a visual approach to upgrade the process of designing nonlinear audio for games and communicating about them, VPA has achieved its goal.
      However, the project only scratches the surface of nonlinear gameaudio possibilities and its current version conditions the user quite heavily into using certain techniques.
      Moreover, the current system isn't easily adaptable enough, mainly due to the Unity based 'objectcomponents approach'. 
      This is also the reason the next (third) experiment completely steps away from this approach.

          The latest experiment is a prototype for a framework/tool designed to improve procedural music systems prototyping and implementing. 
          Even though procedural sound design has become somewhat standard in gameaudio, I find procedural music is still relatively underrepresented. 
          It can be difficult, timeconsuming and expensive to prototype, test and implement. 
        </p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Because it can be difficult to test, it often is a risk to even try out procedural music.
      Procedural music won't work well for every game, but because it is the most dynamic form of nonlinear music, I believe it should be easier to try out.
      Games such as Mini Metro and Monkey Island have succesfully showcased how procedural music can exponentially elevate an entire game.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAS allows for quick testing and implementing procedural music, using a sample-based sequencer. 
      
      The automatic file loading functionally has again been carried over from the first experiment. 

      This project shies away from a visual approach, to put more focus on quick implementation and building a general modular framework.
      PAS's more universal approach and lack of visuals makes it an easy library to implement in any game.
      This does however lead to the programmer also having to be the composer and vice versa.
    </p>

    <h3>Procedural Imagination</h3>
    <p>
    PAS is made as a general framework/tool, but is also used for and tested on 'Procedural Imagination'. 
    A procedurally generated game world that dynamically responds to the player's actions.
    Currently being developed by <a href="http://josienvos.nl/" target="blank">Josien Vos</a>.

    <h3>
      Systems design
    </h3>

    <p>
      External gamedata is used to trigger and generate Cycles. These Cycles set audio parameters for Layers. Layers hold audiofiles and data on when and how to play them. The Sequencer receives ticks from the Clock and checks variables within Layers to trigger audiofiles.

      For a more intricate audiosystem, checking what to play and calling the sounds should be split to reduce the risk of delays.
      <a href="../Media/PI_DataflowWhite.png"target="_blank" >Click here</a> for a more in depth dataflow overview.
    </p>

    <h5>Layers</h5>
      <p>The loaded audio is divided into vertical layers, to be played independently or over each other. A layer can consist of vertical loops or oneshot sound effects. A layer holds data on how, when and what variation to play.
    </p>

    <h5>Generating audiodata</h5>
    <p>Layers contain 'musical values', among which a rythm and a tonal layer. These rythms and melodys are used in the sequencer to check what and when to play. The rythm calls on what ticks audio needs to be played. The tonal layer decides what notes need to be played, based on the Layertype (melody, countermelody, chord, percussion, etc) and the available samples within the layer.
    </p>

    <h5>Cycles</h5>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">  
        <p> A Cycle holds Parameters, that hold values to adjust, values to adjust to and what layers to adjust. Using a Cycle is the only way to adapt audiodata. Cycles can be triggered from game events using a AdaptionMoment or from the sequencer, using a CycleTimer. A DynamicCycle only sets the on/off value of layers. Using a CycleTimer the DynamicCycle can create a natural sounding buildup. For now this buildup is mostly random. In the future specific dynamic structures could be given and/or influenced by external parameters.
          This system is build so that any one parameter or game event can easily be linked to multiple aspects of audiodata. This prevents conditioning the user into using certain systems.

    <h3>
      Unity & C#
    </h3>
    <p>
      To allow for quick testing and implementing, PAS is written in C# for Unity. However, because PAS should serve as a general framework, PAS moves away from a component based Unity hierarchy and uses little to none Unity-specific elements.
      Only the ProceduralAudio component needs to be placed in a scene.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Improvements
    </h3>

    <p>
      The most important goal for this experiment is to investigate improving the audiosystems designing process and encouraging experimentation by removing the obstructions in the workflow.
      The current MVP for this project have been achieved. However, the project could be further developed indefenitly. The most important features that I'd like to add in the near future are:

      <ul style="text-transform: lowercase;">
        <li> easily being able to adapt every single parameter. Probably by converting to C++ to use pointers.</li>
        <li> (adapative) DSP </li>
        <li> variation generation </li>
        <li> AI </li>
        <li> priority system </li>
        <li> more eleborate dynamics system </li>
        <li> probability </li>
        <li> more info from input files </li>
        <li> more intricate algorythms to generate data from </li>
        <li> a visual respresentation and UI such as in N.A.D Visual Parameter Adaption in Unity </li>
      </ul>
